# One Address Instructions CPU

## Computer Organization: Principles, Analysis, and Design

Analysis, design and implementation of the processor. Analysis is covering instruction flow diagram, and implementation is covering operational unit:
- wired realization without and with step joining
- microprogram implementation and horizontal organization, with two types and one type of microinstruction

## Structure

Repository is organized as following:
- `doc` directory contains assignment as well as solution document(s)
- `source` directory contains code
